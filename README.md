# C4E-Structured-Programming-Week4
_WEEK 4 ASSIGNMENT (OPTION 1)_

Open and read a file of integers into an array that is created with the first integer telling you how many to read.

So  4  9  11  12  15  would mean create an int array size 4 and read in the remaining 4 values into data[].

Then compute their average as a double and their max  as an int.  Print all this out neatly to the screen and to an output file named answer-hw3.


_WEEK 4 HONORS ASSIGNMENT_

Open and read a file of integer pairs into an array that is created with the first integer telling you how many to read.  

So  4 9  11  4  5    would mean create an integer array size 4 and read into data[].  

Write a routine that places these values into a binary tree structure. Then walk the tree “inorder” and print these values to the screen.
